  How your coffee is going to taste was determined before the beans were roasted
  by the nutrients in the soil, the varietal of the plant, the weather during the
  season, the aspect of the slope, the insects that nibbled at it, the method of
  processing and the skill and attention of the farmer who processed it.

  We'll explore agronomy in three sections: varietal, terroir and processing.

  For quick explanation of Varietal, terroir and processing, click through to
  Nature and nurture. Explanations are slides that you navigate using the back
  and forward arrows on the left and right. This is best seen on computer or
  tablet. If you're viewing it on a phone, view it in landscape.
